# 2D wave equation using an explicite finite difference method

In this repository it's solving a 2D wave equation and give information for probes in a area.
You can use 3 different boundary condition you can change it with the variable BC= XX. 

Python code.

It will take few minute to calculate the solution and generate a video. 

 

## Requierement
Python 2 or 3

## Theory 
You can look on wikipedia
[Wave equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation)
